#  Day 5 - Functions 

<b>Tasks Activitiess</b>

## Activity 1: Function Declarations
- Task 1: - Write a function to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console
- Task 2: - Write a function to calculate he square of a number and return the result


## Acitivity 2: Function Expression
- Task 3:- Write a function to find the maximum of two numbers and log the result to the console.
- Task 4: - Write a function expression to concatenate two strings and return the result 

## Activity 3: Arrow Functions
- Task 5: - Write an arrow function to calculate the sum of two numbers and return the result
- Task 6: - Write an arrow function to check if a string contains a specific character and return a boolean value.


## Activity 4: Function Parameters and Default Values
- Task 7: - Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product. Provide a default value for the second paramerter. 
- Task 8: - Write a function that takes a person's name and age and returns a greeting message. Provide a default value for the age.
 

## Activity 5: Higher-Order Functions
- Task 9: - Write a higher-order function that takes a function and a number, and calls the function that many times.
- Task 10: - Write a higher-order function that takes two functions and a value, appliese the first function to the value, and then applies the second function to the result.

# Feature Reqest:
