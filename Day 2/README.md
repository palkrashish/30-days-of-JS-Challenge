#  Day 2 - Operators 

<b>Tasks Activitiess</b>

## Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations 
- Task 1: - Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console
- Task 2: - Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console
- Task 3: - Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console
- Task 4: - Wrtie a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- Task 5: - Write a program to find the find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console. 

## Acitivity 2: Assignment Operators
- Task 6:- Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
- Task 7: - Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console

## Activity 3: Comparison Operators
- Task 8: - Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
- Task 9: - Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
- Task 10: - Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console. 

## Activity 4: Logical Operators
- Task 11: - Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- Task 12: - Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- Task 13: - Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

## Activity 5: Ternary Operator
- Task 14: - Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

# Feature Reqest:
## 1 Arithmetic Operations Script:
- Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations(Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results


## 2 Comparison and Logical Operatos Script:
- Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the result.

## 3 Ternary Operators Script:
- Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
